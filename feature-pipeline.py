# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load datasets
# Example: df = pd.read_csv('path/to/dataset.csv')

# Feature Engineering Steps
# Example: df['new_feature'] = df['existing_feature1'] / df['existing_feature2']

# Note: This code is a simplified representation and needs to be fleshed out with actual operations
